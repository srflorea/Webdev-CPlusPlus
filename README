This small project implements the problem of applying a list of
functions on an integer given as parameter.
The functions are located in "examples.cpp" file.
The idea of my implementation is to create a dictionary with the key
being the string that represents the name of a function, and the value
being the function that have to be applied on the integer.
The program take as command line parameters the integer that would be
used and the number of functions that will be applied. At the beggining
of the program all the functions will be added in the dictionary and 
the number of functions that the user wants will be added in a vector 
of strings with the names of the functions. 
Iterating through this vector, will be applied the right functions taken
from the dictionary.
The implementation of the problem is in "webdev.cpp" file.
